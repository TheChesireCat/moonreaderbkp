"Frase, Peter","Peter Frase","""It is easier to imagine the end of the world,"" the theorist Fredric Jameson has remarked, ""than to imagine the end of capitalism. 
"" Jacobin Editor Peter Frase argues that technological advancements and environmental threats will inevitably push our society beyond capitalism, and Four Futures imagines just how this might look. Extrapolating possible futures from current changes the world is now experiencing, and drawing upon speculative fictions to illustrate how these futures might be realized, Four Futures examines communism, rentism, socialism, and exterminism-or in other words, the socialisms we may reach if a resurgent Left is successful and the barbarisms we may be consigned to if those movements fail.

"Dewdney, A. K.","A. K. Dewdney","A mind-bending excursion to the limits of science and mathematics Are some scientific problems insoluble? In Beyond Reason, internationally acclaimed math and science author A. K. Dewdney answers this question by examining eight insurmountable mathematical and scientific roadblocks that have stumped thinkers across the centuries, from ancient mathematical conundrums such as ""squaring the circle,"" first attempted by the Pythagoreans, to G?del's vexing theorem, from perpetual motion to the upredictable behavior of chaotic systems such as the weather. A. K. Dewdney, PhD (Ontario, Canada), was the author of Scientific American's ""Computer Recreations"" column for eight years. He has written several critically acclaimed popular math and science books, including A Mathematical Mystery Tour (0-471-40734-8); Yes, We Have No Neutrons (0-471-29586-8); and 200% of Nothing (0-471-14574-2).

"Prof Robin Dunbar","Prof. Robin Dunbar","### From
  1. Dunbar’s Number: the number establishing the limit on meaningful relationships one person can maintain. In showing how this number reflects the biological history of humans as distinctively social primates, Dunbar illustrates how recent advances in evolutionary science have enlarged the explanatory power of the Darwinian paradigm. Within this increasingly potent paradigm, readers learn, for example, why societies experiencing birth ratios unfavorable to females face serious crime surges in the decades ahead and why tall politicians (e.g., Obama) enjoy a pronounced advantage over short rivals (McCain). Dunbar’s work, of course, connects with the sociobiological theories advanced by E. O.Wilson in the 1980s, leaving some readers with the same questions about the potentially reductive implications of an overly biological framework. Does the distinctively human impulse to worship, for instance, manifest only the way that ritual behavior biochemically fosters group cohesion among anthropoids? Some readers may indeed wonder if Dunbar might not use his science more plausibly if he shared with biologist Peter Medawar an appreciation for its limits. Still, this is lucid and provocative. --Bryce Christensen 


### Review
An eclectic collection of essays on humanity and evolution with something for everyone. Dunbar explains, among other things, why monogamists need big brains, why it is worth buying a new suit for an interview, how to interpret an advert in a lonely hearts column, the perils of messing with evolution and, of course, how many friends one person needs (150 as it happens, aka ""Dunbar's number""). He speaks with authority and seduces us as only a master storyteller can.  
\--Kate Douglas, New Scientist (20101101) 
Lucid and provocative.

"Petzold, Charles","Charles Petzold","Programming Legend Charles Petzold unlocks the secrets of the extraordinary and prescient 1936 paper by Alan M. Turing
Mathematician Alan Turing invented an imaginary computer known as the Turing Machine; in an age before computers, he explored the concept of what it meant to be computable, creating the field of computability theory in the process, a foundation of present-day computer programming.
The book expands Turing’s original 36-page paper with additional background chapters and extensive annotations; the author elaborates on and clarifies many of Turing’s statements, making the original difficult-to-read document accessible to present day programmers, computer science majors, math geeks, and others.
Interwoven into the narrative are the highlights of Turing’s own life: his years at Cambridge and Princeton, his secret work in cryptanalysis during World War II, his involvement in seminal computer projects, his speculations about artificial intelligence, his arrest and prosecution for the crime of ""gross indecency,"" and his early death by apparent suicide at the age of 41.

It is written with a combination of depth and clarity that make it an almost unbroken series of aphorisms. . . . Kuhn does not permit truth to be a criterion of scientific theories, he would presumably not claim his own theory to be true. But if causing a revolution is the hallmark of a superior paradigm, [this book] has been a resounding success."" —Nicholas Wade, *Science* ""Perhaps the best explanation of [the] process of discovery."" —William Erwin Thompson, *New York Times Book Review* ""Occasionally there emerges a book which has an influence far beyond its originally intended audience. . . .

### Amazon.com Review
There's a ""Frank & Ernest"" comic strip showing a chick breaking out of its shell, looking around, and saying, ""Oh, wow! Paradigm shift!"" Blame the late Thomas Kuhn. Few indeed are the philosophers or historians influential enough to make it into the funny papers, but Kuhn is one.
*The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* is indeed a paradigmatic work in the history of science. Kuhn's use of terms such as ""paradigm shift"" and ""normal science,"" his ideas of how scientists move from disdain through doubt to acceptance of a new theory, his stress on social and psychological factors in science--all have had profound effects on historians, scientists, philosophers, critics, writers, business gurus, and even the cartoonist in the street.
Some scientists (such as Steven Weinberg and Ernst Mayr) are profoundly irritated by Kuhn, especially by the doubts he casts--or the way his work has been used to cast doubt--on the idea of scientific progress. Yet it has been said that the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s, for instance, was sped by geologists' reluctance to be on the downside of a paradigm shift. Even Weinberg has said that "" *Structure* has had a wider influence than any other book on the history of science."" As one of Kuhn's obituaries noted, ""We all live in a post-Kuhnian age."" *\--Mary Ellen Curtin*
### Review
Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996) argued that scientific advancement is not evolutionary, but rather is a ""series of peaceful interludes punctuated by intellectually violent revolutions"", and in those revolutions ""one conceptual world view is replaced by another"". The University of Chicago Press has released The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions to the benefit of all students of the history of science, philosophy, and the impact of science on society (and society on the development of science). If every there were a true classic on the history and development of science that is ""must"" reading for each new generation, it is Kuhn's benchmark work, The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions. -- *Midwest Book Review*

"Sapolsky, Robert M.","Robert M. Sapolsky","New York Times **bestseller • Winner of the** Los Angeles Times **Book Prize • One of the** Washington Post **'s 10 Best Books of the Year  
**  
**“It’s no exaggeration to say that** Behave **is one of the best nonfiction books I’ve ever read.” —David P. Barash,** The Wall Street Journal 
**""It has my vote for science book of the year.” —Parul Sehgal,** The New York Times 
**""Immensely readable, often hilarious...Hands-down one of the best books I’ve read in years. I loved it."" —Dina Temple-Raston,** The Washington Post 
From the bestselling author of *A Primate's Memoir* and the forthcoming *Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will* comes a landmark, genre-defining examination of human behavior and an answer to the question: **Why do we do the things we do?**
*Behave* is one of the most dazzling tours d’horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted. Moving across a range of disciplines, Sapolsky—a neuroscientist and primatologist—uncovers the hidden story of our actions. Undertaking some of our thorniest questions relating to tribalism and xenophobia, hierarchy and competition, and war and peace, *Behave* is a towering achievement—a majestic synthesis of cutting-edge research and a heroic exploration of why we ultimately do the things we do . . . for good and for ill.
### Review
**One of** The Washington Post's **10 Best Books of 2017**
""Sapolsky has created an immensely readable, often hilarious romp through the multiple worlds of psychology, primatology, sociology and neurobiology to explain why we behave the way we do. It is hands-down one of the best books I’ve read in years. I loved it."" — **Dina Temple-Raston,** The Washington Post 
“It’s no exaggeration to say that *Behave* is one of the best nonfiction books I’ve ever read.” — **David P. Barash,** The Wall Street Journal 
“A quirky, opinionated and magisterial synthesis of psychology and neurobiology that integrates this complex subject more accessibly and completely than ever . . . a wild and mind-opening ride into a better understanding of just where our behavior comes from. Darwin would have been thrilled.” — **R** **ichard Wrangham,** The New York Times Book Review 
“[Sapolskly’s] new book is his magnum opus, but is also strikingly different from his earlier work, veering sharply toward hard science as it looms myriad strands of his ruminations on human behavior. The familiar, enchanting Sapolsky tropes are here—his warm, witty voice, a sleight of hand that unfolds the mysteries of cognition—but *Behave* keeps the bar high . . . . A stunning achievement and an invaluable addition to the canon of scientific literature, certain to kindle debate for years to come.” —Minneapolis Star Tribune 
“A masterly cross-disciplinary scientific study of human behavior: What in our glands, our genes, our childhoods explains our species’ capacity for both altruism and brutality? This comprehensive and friendly survey of a ‘big sprawling mess of a subject’ is leavened by an impressive data-to-silly joke ratio. It has my vote for science book of the year.” — **Parul Sehgal** , New York Times 
“A monumental contribution to the scientific understanding of human behavior that belongs on every bookshelf and many a course syllabus . . . It is a magnificent culmination of integrative thinking, on par with similar authoritative works, such as Jared Diamond’s *Guns, Germs, and Stee* l and Steven Pinker’s *The Better Angels of Our Nature*.” — **Michael Shermer,** American Scholar 
“ *Behave* is the best detective story ever written, and the most important. If you've ever wondered why someone did something—good or bad, vicious or generous—you need to read this book. If you think you already know why people behave as they do, you need to read this book. In other words, everybody needs to read it. It should be available on prescription (side effects: chronic laughter; highly addictive). They should put *Behave* in hotel rooms instead of the Bible: the world would be a much better, wiser place” — **Kate Fox, author of** Watching the English 
“Magisterial . . . This extraordinary survey of the science of human behaviour takes the reader on an epic journey . . . Sapolsky makes the book consistently entertaining, with an infectious excitement at the puzzles he explains . . . a miraculous synthesis of scholarly domains.” **—Steven Poole,** The Guardian 
“Rarely does an almost 800-page book keep my attention from start to finish, but if anyone can save evolutionary biology from TED talkers and pop-science fabulists, it might be Sapolsky . . . . *Behave* ranges at great length from moral philosophy to social science, genetics to Sapolsky’s home turf of neurons and hormones—but all of it is aimed squarely at the question of why humans are so awful to each other, and whether the condition is terminal.” **—** Vulture 
“Robert Sapolsky's students must love him. In *Behave* , the primatologist, neurologist and science communicator writes like a teacher: witty, erudite and passionate about clear communication. You feel like a lucky auditor in a fast-paced undergraduate course, where the implications of fascinating scientific findings are illuminated through topical stories and pop-culture allusions.” **—** Nature   
**  
** “Sapolsky’s book shows in exquisite detail how culture, context and learning shape everything our genes, brains, hormones and neurons do.” **—** Times Literary Supplement 
“ *Behave* is like a great historical novel, with excellent prose and encyclopedic detail. It traces the most important story that can ever be told.” **—Edward O. Wilson**
“Truly all-encompassing . . . detailed, accessible, fascinating.” **—** The Telegraph 
“A wide-ranging, learned survey of all the making-us-tick things that, for better or worse, define us as human . . . . An exemplary work of popular science, challenging but accessible.” **—** Kirkus Reviews **, starred**
“[Sapolsky] weaves science storytelling with humor . . . . [His] big ideas deserve a wide audience and will likely shape thinking for some time.” **—** Publishers Weekly **(starred review)**
“[Sapolsky] does an excellent job of bringing together the expansive literature of thousands of fascinating studies with clarity and humor . . . . A tour-de-force.” **—** Library Journal **(starred review)**
“Sapolsky finds not the high moral drama of the soul choosing good or evil but rather down-to-earth biology . . . a remarkably encyclopedic survey of the sciences illuminating human conduct.”  
**—** Booklist **(starred review)**
“Read Robert Sapolsky’s marvelous book *Behave* and you’ll never again be surprised by the range and depth of our own bad behavior. We all carry the potential for unconscious biases, to be damaged by our childhoods and map that damage onto our own loved ones, and to form the tribal ‘Us’ groups that treat outsiders as lesser ‘Thems.’ But to read this book is also, marvelously, to be given the hope that we have much more control of those behaviors than we think. And *Behave* gives us more than hope—it gives us the knowledge of how to act on that aspiration, to manifest more of our best selves and less of our worst, individually and as a society. That’s very good news indeed.” **—Charles Duhigg, author of** The Power of Habit **and** Smarter Faster Better 
""As wide as it is deep, this book is colorful, electrifying, and moving. Sapolsky leverages his deep expertise to ask the most fundamental questions about being human **—** from acts of hate to acts of love, from our compulsion to dehumanize to our capacity to rehumanize."" **—David Eagleman, PhD, neuroscientist at Stanford, author, presenter of PBS's** The Brain 
"" *Behave* is a beautifully crafted work about the biology of morality. Sapolsky makes multiple passes at the target, using different time scales and systems. He shows you how all the perspectives and systems connect, and he makes you laugh and marvel along the way. Sapolsky is not just a leading primatologist; he’s a great writer and a superb guide to human nature."" **—Jonathan Haidt, New York University, author of** The Righteous Mind 
“This is a miraculous book, by far the best treatment of violence, aggression, and competition ever. It ranges from how neurons and hormones interact, how emotions are an essential part of decision making, why adolescents are more likely to be violent than adults, why genes influence cultures and vice-versa, and the ins and outs of “we versus them,” all the way to “live and let live” truces in World War I and the My Lai massacre. Its depth and breadth of scholarship are amazing, building on Sapolsky’s own research and his vast knowledge of the neurobiology, genetic, and behavioral literature. For instance, *Behave* includes fair evaluations of complex debates (like over sociobiology) that I was involved in, and tackles controversial questions such as whether our hunter-gatherer ancestors warred on each other. He even takes on “free will” with a clarity usually absent from the writings of philosophers on the subject. All this is done brilliantly with a light and funny touch that shows why Sapolsky is recognized as one of the greatest teachers in science today.” **—Paul R. Ehrlich, author of** Human Natures

"Lakoff, George & Johnson, Mark","George Lakoff & Mark Johnson","The now-classic *Metaphors We Live By* changed our understanding of metaphor and its role in language and the mind. Metaphor, the authors explain, is a fundamental mechanism of mind, one that allows us to use what we know about our physical and social experience to provide understanding of countless other subjects. Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of our experience, they are ""metaphors we live by""—metaphors that can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing them. 
In this updated edition of Lakoff and Johnson's influential book, the authors supply an afterword surveying how their theory of metaphor has developed within the cognitive sciences to become central to the contemporary understanding of how we think and how we express our thoughts in language.

"Luhmann, Niklas & Luhmann, Professor Niklas","Niklas Luhmann & Professor Niklas Luhmann","Modern systems theory provides a new paradigm for the analysis of society. In this volume, Niklas Luhmann, its leading exponent, explores its implications for our understanding of law. Luhmann argues that current thinking about how law operates within a modern society is seriously deficient. In this volume he lays out the theoretical and methodological tools that, he argues, can advance our understanding of contemporary society and, in particular, of the identity, performance, and function of the legal system within that society. In systems theory, society is its communications: they are its empirical reality; the items that can be observed and studied. Systems theory identifies how communications operate within a physical world and how different sub-systems of communication operate alongside each other. In this volume, Luhmann uses systems theory to address a question central to legal theory: what differentiates law from other parts of society?

"Wray, K. Brad","K. Brad Wray","Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions offers an insightful and engaging theory of science that speaks to scholars across many disciplines. Though initially widely misunderstood, it had a profound impact on the way intellectuals and educated laypeople thought about science. K. Brad Wray traces the influences on Kuhn as he wrote Structure, including his 'Aristotle epiphany', his interactions, and his studies of the history of chemistry. Wray then considers the impact of Structure on the social sciences, on the history of science, and on the philosophy of science, where the problem of theory change has set the terms of contemporary realism/anti-realism debates. He examines Kuhn's frustrations with the Strong Programme sociologists' appropriations of his views, and debunks several popular claims about what influenced Kuhn as he wrote Structure. His book is a rich and comprehensive assessment of one of the most influential works in the modern sciences.

"Hinuber, Oskar von","Oskar von Hinuber","The Handbook deals with the whole of the literature in Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, which is still alive in Ceylon and South-East Asia. In addition to reviewing the canonical texts (Tipitaka) which forms the oldest body of extant Buddhist literature, and their commentaries, the Handbook presents the later Pali literature, written after the 12th century, much of which is only available in Oriental prints. The account not only summarizes the findings of earlier research, but extends the scope of a handbook by demonstrating new methodological approaches to the canonical literature, for example by showing how the strict formal structure of the Sutra texts is determined in part by their oral transmission. Questions of the authorship of the commentaries on the canon (post-5th century AD) are revisited and the chronology of the texts critically examined. By comparing parallel commentaries, insights are gained into the structure of this comprehensive structure. Access to the Handbook is provided by a number of indexes.

"Freire, Paulo","Paulo Freire","With the publication of Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Paulo Freire established himself as one of the most important and radical educational thinkers of his time. In Pedagogy of Hope, Freire revisits the themes of his masterpiece, the real world contexts that inspired them and their impact in that very world. Freire's abiding concern for social justice and education in the developing world remains as timely and as inspiring as ever, and is shaped by both his rigorous intellect and his boundless compassion. Pedagogy of Hope is a testimonial to the inner vitality of generations denied prosperity and to the often-silent, generous strength of millions throughout the world who refuse to let hope be extinguished. This edition includes a substantial new introduction by Henry A. Giroux, University Chair for Scholarship in the Public Interest and the Paulo Freire Distinguished Scholar in Critical Pedagogy at McMaster University, Canada.

"Khan, Salman","Salman Khan","A free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere: this is the goal of the Khan Academy, a passion project that grew from an ex-engineer and hedge funder's online tutoring sessions with his niece, who was struggling with algebra, into a worldwide phenomenon. Today millions of students, parents, and teachers use the Khan Academy's free videos and software, which have expanded to encompass nearly every conceivable subject; and Academy techniques are being employed with exciting results in a growing number of classrooms around the globe. 
Like many innovators, Khan rethinks existing assumptions and imagines what education could be if freed from them. And his core idea-liberating teachers from lecturing and state-mandated calendars and opening up class time for truly human interaction-has become his life's passion. Schools seek his advice about connecting to students in a digital age, and people of all ages and backgrounds flock to the site to utilize this fresh approach to learning. 
In The One World Schoolhouse, Khan presents his radical vision for the future of education, as well as his own remarkable story, for the first time. In these pages, you will discover, among other things: 
  * How both students and teachers are being bound by a broken top-down model invented in Prussia two centuries ago 
  * Why technology will make classrooms more human and teachers more important 
  * How and why we can afford to pay educators the same as other professionals 
  * How we can bring creativity and true human interactivity back to learning 
  * Why we should be very optimistic about the future of learning.


Parents and politicians routinely bemoan the state of our education system. Statistics suggest we've fallen behind the rest of the world in literacy, math, and sciences. With a shrewd reading of history, Khan explains how this crisis presented itself, and why a return to ""mastery learning,"" abandoned in the twentieth century and ingeniously revived by tools like the Khan Academy, could offer the best opportunity to level the playing field, and to give all of our children a world-class education now. 
More than just a solution, The One World Schoolhouse serves as a call for free, universal, global education, and an explanation of how Khan's simple yet revolutionary thinking can help achieve this inspiring goal.
### Review
""Since its founding in 2006, Sal Khan's project-the Khan academy-has revolutionized our thinking on the potential and promise of unfettered, open-access online education. In his new book The One World Schoolhouse, Khan presents his vision and blueprint for how online technology can, and should, play an integral role in educating communities across the globe, closing the opportunity gap and providing high-quality education for all.""―Al Gore 
""In this book, Salman Khan sheds light on how our current education system leaves a gap in every student's core knowledge. He found ways to fill this gap by encouraging differentness, fresh thinking and implementing creativity in the learning process. I strongly believe that all human beings have unlimited creative power. The role of education is to unleash that power. The way he relates the proper goal of education and the natural bent of the child is fascinating. He refers ""natural bent"" as the particular mix of talents and perspectives that makes each mind unique, and allows minds to be strikingly original. The way Khan portrays the concept of education and the mechanism of learning is revolutionary. This book is a must-read for those providing real education to our children in this new age of technology.""―Muhammed Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank, and the 2006 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize 
""Sal Khan's passion and innovation is transforming learning for millions of students worldwide. The One World School is a must-read for all who are committed to improving education so students everywhere can gain the skills and knowledge to be successful in school, careers and life.""―George Lucas, Filmmaker and Founder of The George Lucas Educational Foundation, publisher of Edutopia 
""I discovered Sal Khan and Khan Academy like most other people - by using these incredible tools with my own kids. Sal Khan's vision and energy for how technology could fundamentally transform education is contagious. He's a true pioneer in integrating technology and learning. I'm happy that, through this book, even more people will be introduced to this ground-breaking innovator.""―Bill Gates, co-founder & Chairman, Microsoft 
""The world dreams of education reform, and Sal Khan is delivering. His pioneering video lessons have brought the thrill of learning to millions. In this compelling book, he tells the remarkable story of Khan Academy, and explains the potential in students learning at their own pace and achieving true subject mastery.""―Chris Anderson, TED Curator 
""Sal Khan makes a powerful argument for fundamentally rethinking the way we teach and learn. THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE illuminates the tremendous potential for online, universaleducation to enable any child, anywhere in the world, to succeed-not only in school, but in shaping our future.""―Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google 
""Sal Khan is changing what we believe is possible in education. Through humor, charm, contagious enthusiasm and quiet brilliance, Sal Khan has made his lessons irresistible. Now, he brings those same gifts to explaining the revolutionary ideas behind Khan Academy. You'll adore this book because it's just like his lessons-approachable, good-hearted, smart, and ultimately profound. The story Sal tells is quite simply the story of what education will become... and indeed IS becoming, thanks to his example and to a generation of inspired teachers and intrepid education entrepreneurs.""―Ted Mitchell, President and CEO, NewSchools Venture Fund 
""When you read this book, you will understand how the dignity of each student is addressed by education's visionary, Sal Khan.""―Ann Doerr 
""Sal Khan has developed the best and most cost-efficient way to use technology to bring high quality education, creativity and innovation to all countries, including the poorest.""―Carlos Slim Helu

"Weir, Andy","Andy Weir","**A lone astronaut must save the earth from disaster in this incredible new science-based thriller from the #1** New York Times **bestselling author of** The Martian **.  
  
“A novel that would have delighted Robert A. Heinlein and Isaac Asimov.”—George R. R. Martin, author of **A Game of Thrones **  
  
“Weir’s finest work to date . . . the one book I read last year that I am certain I can recommend to anyone, no matter who, and know they’ll love it.”—Brandon Sanderson, author of the Stormlight Archive series**  
  
Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission—and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.  
  
Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.  
  
All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.  
  
His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.  
  
And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he’s got to do it all alone.  
  
Or does he?  
  
An irresistible interstellar adventure as only Andy Weir could deliver, *Project Hail Mary* is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival *The Martian* —while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.
**Amazon.com Review**
**An Amazon Best Book of May 2021:** As Ryland Grace awakens from a coma, he doesn’t know who he is or where he is, but a mix of calculations, deductions, and slowly returning memories enlightens him: He’s a junior high school science teacher on a small space ship. His mission? Save Earth. As in *The Martian* , Weir makes science and problem solving not only cool but absolutely essential to survival, delivering an electrifying space adventure that yanks at both the gut and the heart strings. Readers will absorb facts about gravity and heavy metals even as Grace races against the clock and builds an unexpected partnership while hurtling through the cold depths of space. *—Adrian Liang, Amazon Book Review*
### **Review**
“A propulsive adventure.” **—** Entertainment Weekly  
  
“Weir spins a space yarn in a way only he can. Fans of his earlier works won’t be disappointed.” **—** Newsweek  
  
“Andy Weir proves once again that he is a singular talent. *Project Hail Mary* is so fascinating and propulsive that it’s downright addictive. From the first page as Ryland wakes up not knowing who or where he is, I was hooked.” **—Taylor Jenkins Reid,** New York Times **bestselling author of** Daisy Jones & The Six **  
  
“Reading *Project Hail Mary* is like going on a field trip to outer space with the best science teacher you’ve ever had—and your class assignment is to save the world. This is one of the most original, compelling, and fun voyages I’ve ever taken.” **—Ernest Cline, #1** New York Times **bestselling author of** Ready Player One  
  
“Two worlds in peril, a competent (but flawed and human) man, a competent alien, unending scientific puzzles to unravel, with humanity itself at risk, this one has everything fans of old school SF (like me) love. If you like a lot of science in your science fiction, Andy Weir is the writer for you.” **—George R. R. Martin,** New York Times **bestselling author of** A Game of Thrones  
  
“I loved *The Martian,* but I actually find *Project Hail Mary* to be Mr. Weir’s finest work to date. It’s somehow both exciting, yet also personal. I’m constantly amazed by how well Mr. Weir continues to write wonderfully accessible science fiction without compromising either the science or the fiction.” **—Brandon Sanderson,** New York Times **bestselling author of the Stormlight Archive series**  
  
“Brilliantly funny and enjoyable . . . one of the most plausible science fiction books I’ve ever read.” **—Tim Peake, ESA astronaut and internationally bestselling author of** Limitless  
  
“Thrilling doesn’t even begin to describe *Project Hail Mary* , which is undisputedly the best book I’ve read in a very, very long time . . . I cheered, I laughed (a lot), I cried, and when the twist arrived and the book revealed its true target, my jaw hit the floor. Mark my words: *Project Hail Mary* is destined to become a classic.” **—Blake Crouch,** New York Times **bestselling author of  
** Recursion **and** Dark Matter  
  
“A joy to read . . . with *Project Hail Mary,* Weir is leaning hard into all that made *The Martian* kick.” **—** Locus  
  
“Readers may find themselves consuming this emotionally intense and thematically profound novel in one stay-up-all-night-until-your-eyes-bleed sitting. An unforgettable story of survival and the power of friendship—nothing short of a science fiction masterwork.”—Kirkus Reviews **(starred review)**
### **About the Author**

Then his long-lost uncle Jake dies and leaves his supervillain business (complete with island volcano lair) to Charlie.   
But becoming a supervillain isn't all giant laser death rays and lava pits. Jake had enemies, and now they're coming after Charlie. His uncle might have been a stand-up, old-fashioned kind of villain, but these are the real thing: rich, soulless predators backed by multinational corporations and venture capital.   
It's up to Charlie to win the war his uncle started against a league of supervillains. But with unionized dolphins, hyper-intelligent talking spy cats, and a terrifying henchperson at his side, going bad is starting to look pretty good.  
In a dog-eat-dog world...be a cat.

"Emerson, Ralph Waldo","Ralph Waldo Emerson","""Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. 
""-Ralph Waldo Emerson, The Over-Soul The Over-Soul (1841) is a treatise on transcendentalism. Emerson was one of the original authors of this philosophical system, and in his essay, he argues the basic principles of individualism and free thought. He also elaborates on his belief that God lives in each of us, that we can communicate with the spiritual world without any formal religious affiliation, and that our souls are limitless, free to rise above the petty circumstances of daily life and to merge with the universal spirit.

### Review
""Woodard fashions a point-by-point comparison between classical Latin and Greek accounts of certain archaic Roman ceremonies that demarcate, celebrate, and hallow civic space . . . and some of the many painstakingly detailed prescriptions for sacrifice in which the brahmanic literature of ancient India abounds.""  
\-- *Indo-European Studies Bulletin*
""A stimulating, thought-provoking, and structured account of what can appear to be random and inexplicable details in the synchronic system, a way of thinking 'outside the box' of a single culture.""-- *Journal of the American Oriental Society*
""A great and beautiful book.""-- *History of Religions*
### Book Description
Explaining the survival of Proto-Indo-European cultic spaces in Vedic India and ancient Rome
In Indo-European Sacred Space, Roger D. Woodard provides a careful examination of the sacred spaces of ancient Rome, finding them remarkably consistent with older Indo-European religious practices as described in the Vedas of ancient India. Employing and expanding on the fundamental methods of Émile Benveniste, as well as Georges Dumézil’s tripartite analysis of Proto-Indo-European society, Woodard clarifies not only the spatial dynamics of the archaic Roman cult but, stemming from that, an unexpected clarification of several obscure issues in the study of Roman religion.
Looking closely at the organization of Roman religious activity, especially as regards sacrifices, festivals, and the hierarchy of priests, Woodard sheds new light on issues including the presence of the god Terminus in Jupiter's Capitoline temple, the nature of the Roman suovetaurilia, the Ambarvalia and its relationship to the rites of the Fratres Arvales, and the identification of the ""Sabine"" god Semo Sancus. Perhaps most significantly, this work also presents a novel and persuasive resolution to the long-standing problem of “agrarian Mars.”

"Augusto S. Cacopardo, Augusto S. Cacopardo","Augusto S. Cacopardo, Augusto S. Cacopardo","This authoritative work sheds light on the religious world of the Kalasha people of the Birir valley in the Chitral district of Pakistan, focusing on their winter feasts, which culminate every year in a great winter solstice festival. The Kalasha are not only the last example of a pre-Islamic culture in the Hindu Kush and Karakorum mountains but also practice the last observable example anywhere in the world of an archaic Indo-European religion. In this book, Augusto S. Cacopardo takes readers inside the world of the Kalasha people. Cacopardo outlines the history and culture of this ancient but still extant people. Exploring an array of relevant literature, he enriches our understanding of their practices and beliefs through illuminating comparisons with both the Indian religious world and the religious folklore of Europe. Bringing together several disciplinary approaches and drawing on extensive ethnographic fieldwork, this book offers the first extended study of this little-known but fascinating Kalasha community. It will take its place as a standard international reference source on the anthropology, ethnography, and history of religions in Pakistan and Central South Asia.","/Users/natkite/Calibre Library/Augusto S.

"Witzel, Michael","Michael Witzel","This remarkable book is the most ambitious work on mythology since that of the renowned Mircea Eliade, who all but single-handedly invented the modern study of myth and religion. Focusing on the oldest available texts, buttressed by data from archeology, comparative linguistics and human population genetics, Michael Witzel reconstructs a single original African source for our collective myths, dating back some 100,000 years. Identifying features shared by this ""Out of Africa"" mythology and its northern Eurasian offshoots, Witzel suggests that these common myths--recounted by the communities of the ""African Eve""--are the earliest evidence of ancient spirituality. Moreover these common features, Witzel shows, survive today in all major religions. Witzel's book is an intellectual hand grenade that will doubtless generate considerable excitement--and consternation--in the scholarly community. Indeed, everyone interested in mythology will want to grapple with Witzel's extraordinary hypothesis about the spirituality of our common ancestors, and to understand what it tells us about our modern cultures and the way they are linked at the deepest level.
### Review
""Not since Frazer's Golden Bough has anyone achieved such a grand synthesis of world mythology. Boldly swimming upstream against the present scholarly emphasis on difference and context, Witzel assembles massive evidence for a single, prehistoric, Ur-mythology. An astonishing book.""--Wendy Doniger, Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions at the University of Chicago and author of *The Woman Who Pretended to Be Who She Was* ""[Witzel's] novel approach brings a different perspective to the myths he analyzes. By all rights, this book should provoke debate and is, therefore, indispensable to any research library. Summing Up: Essential."" -- *CHOICE*

"Thapar, Romila","Romila Thapar","The question of which of us is Aryan is one of the most contentious in India today. In this eyeopening book, scholars and experts critically examine the Aryan issue by analysing history, genetics, early Vedic scriptures, archaeology and linguistics to test and challenge various hypotheses, myths, facts and theories that are currently in vogue. Romila Thapar tackles the definition of the 'Aryan' in her inimitable style by tracing the origins and progression of the 'Aryans' from old Iranian texts such as the Zend-Avesta, archaeological excavations and colonial interpretations made by Max Müeller. She also touches upon the following fields of enquiry: historiography, archaeology, linguistics, comparative mythology, social anthropology and, more recently, genetics. Michael Witzel investigates the origins of the early 'Aryans' within and outside India. Jaya Menon examines data from excavations of Harappan culture. Kai Friese lucidly explains the Rakhigarhi research which has been talked about a lot in the recent past and Razib Khan provides insights arising from research into genetics.

"Daniels, Peter T. & Bright, William","Peter T. Daniels & William Bright","Ranging from cuneiform to shorthand, from archaic Greek to modern Chinese, from Old Persian to modern Cherokee, this is the only available work in English to cover all of the world's writing systems from ancient times to the present. Describing scores of scripts in use now or in the past around the world, this unusually comprehensive reference offers a detailed exploration of the history and typology of writing systems. More than eighty articles by scholars from over a dozen countries explain and document how a vast array of writing systems work--how alphabets, ideograms, pictographs, and hieroglyphics convey meaning in graphic form. The work is organized in thirteen parts, each dealing with a particular group of writing systems defined historically, geographically, or conceptually. Arranged according to the chronological development of writing systems and their historical relationships within geographical areas, the scripts are divided into the following sections: the ancient Near East, East Asia, Europe, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. Additional parts address the ongoing process of decipherment of ancient writing systems; the adaptation of traditional scripts to new languages; new scripts invented in modern times; and graphic symbols for numerical, music, and movement notation. Each part begins with an introductory article providing the social and cultural context in which the group of writing systems was developed. Articles on individual scripts detail the historical origin of the writing system, its structure (with tables showing the forms of the written symbols), and its relationship to the phonology of the corresponding spoken language.

This book fits in perfectly in this gap and also provides a narration on the impact this movement had on the people. Bipin Chandra’s book is a well-documented history of India's freedom struggle against the British rule. It is one of the most accurate books which have been painstakingly written after thorough research based on legal and valid verbal and written sources. It maps the first war of independence that started with Mangal Pandey’s mutiny and witnessed the gallant effort of Sri Rani Laxmi Bai. Many of the pages of this book are dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi’s non-cooperation and the civil disobedience movements. It contains detailed description of Subash Chandra Bose’s weapon heavy tactics and his charisma. This book includes all the independence movements and fights, irrespective of their size and impact, covering India in its entirety. Although these movements varied in means and ideas, but they shared a common goal of independence. This book contains oral and written narratives from different parts of the country, making this book historically rich and diverse. The book captures the evolution of Indian independence struggle in full detail and leaves no chapter of this story untouched. This book is a good read for the students of Indian modern history and especially for students who are preparing for UPSC examination and have taken History as their subject.

“An enchanting tale of Pinocchio in the end times.” —P. Djèlí Clark** 
In a strange little home built into the branches of a grove of trees, live three robots—fatherly inventor android Giovanni Lawson, a pleasantly sadistic nurse machine, and a small vacuum desperate for love and attention. Victor Lawson, a human, lives there too. They’re a family, hidden and safe. 
The day Vic salvages and repairs an unfamiliar android labeled “HAP,” he learns of a shared dark past between Hap and Gio–a past spent hunting humans. 
When Hap unwittingly alerts robots from Gio’s former life to their whereabouts, the family is no longer hidden and safe. Gio is captured and taken back to his old laboratory in the City of Electric Dreams. So together, the rest of Vic’s assembled family must journey across an unforgiving and otherworldly country to rescue Gio from decommission, or worse, reprogramming. 
Along the way to save Gio, amid conflicted feelings of betrayal and affection for Hap, Vic must decide for himself: Can he accept love with strings attached? 
Inspired by Carlo Collodi's *The Adventures of Pinocchio* , and like *Swiss Family Robinson* meets *Wall-E* , *In the Lives of Puppets* is a masterful stand-alone fantasy adventure from the beloved author who brought you *The House in the Cerulean Sea* and *Under the Whispering Door.*

"Rahman, Zia Haider","Zia Haider Rahman","A bold, epic debut novel set during the war and financial crisis that defined the beginning of our century
One September morning in 2008, an investment banker approaching forty, his career in collapse and his marriage unraveling, receives a surprise visitor at his West London townhouse. In the disheveled figure of a South Asian male carrying a backpack, the banker recognizes a long-lost friend, a mathematics prodigy who disappeared years earlier under mysterious circumstances. The friend has resurfaced to make a confession of unsettling power.  
 *In the Light of What We Know* takes us on a journey of exhilarating scope--from Kabul to London, New York, Islamabad, Oxford, and Princeton--and explores the great questions of love, belonging, science, and war. It is an age-old story: the friendship of two men and the betrayal of one by the other. The visitor, a man desperate to climb clear of his wrong beginnings, seeks atonement; and the narrator sets out to tell his friend's story but finds himself at the limits of what he can know about the world--and, ultimately, himself. Set against the breaking of nations and beneath the clouds of economic crisis, this surprisingly tender novel chronicles the lives of people carrying unshakable legacies of class and culture as they struggle to tame their futures.  
In an extraordinary feat of imagination, Zia Haider Rahman has telescoped the great upheavals of our young century into a novel of rare intimacy and power.
### From Booklist
This expansive novel sprawls over the past half-century and has as its primary settings the U.S., the UK, and South Asia. Its nameless narrator is an upper-class Englishman of Pakistani parentage, and its main character and secondary voice is the Bangladeshi-born Zafar, the narrator’s brilliant former Oxford classmate. Our narrator gets ensnared in the banking scandals of the early 2000s, and Zafar in the coterminous conflict in Afghanistan. This is, in part, a novel of international geopolitics going back to American involvement (or inaction) in the South Asian wars of 1971; in part, a novel of global finance; in referential detail, a novel of ideas; and, in addition, a novel of personal relationships in which issues of caste and class figure prominently. The narrator (and the book’s author) has background on Wall Street, and the complex narrative weaves together the strands of worldwide interconnectedness with which both are familiar. This is a big book with grand themes, and while some readers may enjoy its discursiveness, others might wish for a tighter narrative style. --Mark Levine
### Review
“Rahman's novel [is] astonishingly achieved for a first book…Rahman proves himself a deep and subtle storyteller, with a very good eye for dramatic detail--the wounding stray comment, the surge of shame, the livid parable... *In the Light of What We Know* is what Salman Rushdie once called an ‘everything novel.' It is wide-armed, hospitable, disputatious, worldly, cerebral. Ideas and provocations abound on every page.” ― *James Wood, The New Yorker*
“An ambitious novel by any measure, *In the Light of What We Know* is particularly striking as a first novel. …[It] is a novel of ideas, a compendium of epiphanies, paradoxes, and riddles clearly designed to be read slowly and meditatively… [A] unique work of fiction bearing witness to much that is unspeakable in human relationships as in international relations, while it is also unknowable.” ― *Joyce Carol Oates, New York Review of Books*
“[A] strange and brilliant novel . . . I was surprised it didn't explode in my hands.” ― *Amitava Kumar, The New York Times Book Review*
“[B]ristling with ideas about mathematics and politics, history and religion, Rahman's novel also wrestles with the intricacies of the 2008 financial crash. It is encyclopedic in its reach and depth, dazzling in its erudition... *In the Light of What We Know* is an extraordinary meditation on the limits and uses of human knowledge, a heartbreaking love story and a gripping account of one man's psychological disintegration. This is the novel I'd hoped Jonathan Franzen's *Freedom* would be (but wasn't)--an exploration of the post-9/11 world that is both personal and political, epic and intensely moving.” ― *Alex Preston, The Guardian*
“[A]n ambitious and extraordinary achievement . . . Pre-eminently a novel of ideas, the book overflows with sparkling essays on free will, the perception of time, the nature of memory, maps, flags, etymology and the axioms of mathematics... As a meditation on the penalties of exile, the need for roots and the ways in which anger can consume a thoughtful man slighted by prejudice, this is a dazzling debut.” ― *Sunday Times (UK)*
“[A] sweeping and brilliant tale... Rahman's rich and complex debut novel is like [a] great meal... *In the Light of What We Know* may be the best meal you eat this year. [Rahman's] insights--whether related to Pakistan-India enmity, Ivy-League attitude or non-governmental organizations' idealism--were right on target, [his] characters' experiences plausible and compelling, and [his] grasp of the widely varied subjects in the novel was breathtaking.” ― *Paul Overby, Pittsburg Post-Gazette*
“[A] hugely impressive… and profound debut… The book's depth is utterly absorbing, its stories as real in their effect as they are illusory.” ― *Alex Clark, The Guardian*
“Beautifully written and renewed evidence that some of the most interesting writing in English is coming from the edges of old empires.” ― *Kirkus (starred review)*
“ *[In The Light of What We Know]* is a splendidly enterprising debut.” ― *The Wall Street Journal*
“[Rahman's] fascination with mathematics and the universe of ideas is contagious, and enriches the complex narrative about how we know the reality around us… [T]his ambitious debut novel has considerable depth and scope.” ― *Library Journal (starred review)*
“[I]t is immediately apparent that one is dealing with a work of major ambition…[T]he main reason to get excited over Rahman's emerging presence as a writer are his sentences, ramifying and unraveling to bring in more and more ideas between full-stops in a way that few still alive can command.” ― *Nicholas Muncusi, The Daily Beast*
“ *[In the Light of What We Know is]* epic in scale and reach, and pulsing with life.” ― *The National*
“[A] a sprawling and thrillingly ambitious debut novel…A cross between Herman Melville and David Foster Wallace as refracted through Graham Greene, *In the Light of What We Know* offers 500 pages of self-described ""digressions"" and ""tangents"" involving bracing, sometimes mind-blowing discussions of high math, theoretical physics, cognitive science, Central Asian politics, the English class system, the bloody birth of Bangladesh, Bach, literature, epistemology, collateralized debt obligations and the 2008 collapse of world markets... Rahman drives home that every story is a lie. But stories like this one can teach us great truths about the ways we see--and how much we therefore miss.” ― *Mike Fischer, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel*
“[A] standout debut.” ― *Vogue*
“This formidable and compelling novel offers the reader pleasures not often found in the same venue. Its boldness in engaging elements of our contemporary crisis is bracing. In presenting his cast of characters, Rahman supplies close readings of class, mores, and manners that are extraordinary. And throughout, he sustains an almost subliminal resonance with the conventions, strengths, and tone of certain classic social novels in the English canon--Conrad's in particular. This is a debut to celebrate.” ― *Norman Rush, author of Mating and Subtle Bodies*
“Here it is, the vast and brilliant debut novel of our time for which readers have been waiting. Set against the backdrop of economic crises and the war in Afghanistan, Zia Haider Rahman's novel about a troubled friendship between two men--one born in the United States to well-placed parents from Pakistan, and the other born in Bangladesh--is deeply penetrating and profoundly intimate, as if made by a muralist whose heart belongs to the details. *In the Light of What We Know* is a novel of startling vision, written in a prose that's as strong and bold as it is impeccable. Who's the true heir to such greats as George Orwell and V.S. Naipaul? It's Zia Haider Rahman.” ― *Richard McCann, author of Mother of Sorrows*
“Brilliant and heartbreaking, *In the Light of What We Know* is the first truly great book of the new century.” ― *Ceridwen Dovey, author of Blood Kin*

"Gill, Kanan","Kanan Gill","Channelling the craft of Neil Gaiman, the humour of Douglas Adams and the genius of Terry Pratchett, Kanan Gill weaves a story that will surprise you. It refuses to take itself seriously, yet raises the most serious of questions - what does it mean to be human?In a post-nuclear winter world, now free from borders, war, poverty and overpopulation, the smartest man on the planet is working on the most illegal thing imaginable. Once a celebrated scientist for whom the Authority had to come up with an entirely new 'Genius Category 3', Dr K has resigned as the head of the Scientific Institute and now spends his days in a hungover, crotchety haze, relegated to working on a trifling project. But unknown to everyone else, he is obsessively simulating universes, intervening in these simulations, and when they fail to achieve what he wants, terminating them.But all of his delicate interferences to nudge these simulated realities in the right direction inevitably come up short against the most unlikely spanner in the works - bumbling private detective P. Manjunath.In Kanan Gill's wildly entertaining and unexpectedly moving debut novel, a Danish policeman accidentally becomes a clothing-optional leader of a worldwide group of science haters, a sentient piece of wall struggles with the limits of its artistic expression and a lapel pin's habit of always giving truthful advice causes chaos. Blending vivid inventiveness and uproarious storytelling, with an intriguing interrogation of the very nature of existence, Acts of God marks the evolution of one of our finest comedic voices.

The astonishing biography of one of the world’s most influential books. 
During the thirteenth century, the Persian naturalist and judge Zakariyyāʾ Qazwīnī authored what became one of the most influential works of natural history in the world: *Wonders and Rarities*. Exploring the dazzling movements of the stars above, the strange minutiae of the minerals beneath the earth, and everything in between, Qazwīnī offered a captivating account of the cosmos. With fine paintings and leading science, *Wonders and Rarities* inspired generations as it traveled through madrasas and courts, unveiling the magical powers of nature. Yet after circulating for centuries, first in Arabic and Persian, then in Turkish and Urdu, Qazwīnī’s compendium eventually came to stand as a strange, if beautiful, emblem of medieval ignorance. 
Restoring Qazwīnī to his place as a herald of the rare and astonishing, Travis Zadeh dramatically revises the place of wonder in the history of Islamic philosophy, science, and literature. From the Mongol conquests to the rise of European imperialism and Islamic reform, Zadeh shows, wonder provided an enduring way to conceive of the world―at once constituting an affective reaction, an aesthetic stance, a performance of piety, and a cognitive state. Yet through the course of colonial modernity, Qazwīnī’s universe of marvels helped advance the notion that Muslims lived in a timeless world of superstition and enchantment, unaware of the western hemisphere or the earth’s rotation around the sun. 
Recovering Qazwīnī’s ideas and his reception, Zadeh invites us into a forgotten world of thought, where wonder mastered the senses through the power of reason and the pleasure of contemplation.
### Review
“As Zadeh concludes, reformers and modernists have closed the rich and varied archive revealed in *Wonders and Rarities* …In this beautifully written and engaging text, Zadeh takes his readers back to the world of surprise and enchantment that preceded this closure.”― **Malise Ruthven** **,** Financial Times 
“The wonders and curiosities of the Islamic imagination await discovery by a new generation of readers in this superb and very enjoyable book by Travis Zadeh.”― **Orhan Pamuk, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature**
“Like al-Qazwīnī himself, Travis Zadeh has written a deliciously baggy tome, full of delights and diversions in its tour of the cosmic horizons. This is a book to get lost in, whether one wants to or not. Zadeh describes the ʿAjaʾib al-Makhlūqāt as containing a ‘world within a book.’ In his own *Wonders and Rarities* , he has managed something similar himself.”― **Nile Green** **,** Los Angeles Review of Books 
“This book about a book, like the book it describes, is a rare and marvelous thing…In his passionate and erudite mission to restore Qazwini to centre stage, [Zadeh] has given readers a book filled with its own wonder and marvels. Like his hero, he well understands the most important thing: ‘What matters is a good story.’”― **Justin Marozzi** **,** The Spectator 
“ *Wonders and Rarities* has been studied by art historians in particular, but Travis Zadeh sets it in the context of wider Islamic thought…Indeed, he faces the mammoth task of mastering the same range of disciplines as Qazwini himself, from alchemy to botany, philosophy, theology and zoology. These feats are themselves worthy of wonder.”― **Helen Pfeifer** **,** London Review of Books 
“A study of the wondrous, marvelous, and strange in the Islamicate context…This book contributes to our understanding of an intellectually vibrant world full of wondrous anecdotes, magic, science, and poetry.”―Reading Religion 
“A remarkable account of how a single text captivated readers for centuries, across the boundaries of language, religion, culture, and politics. Travis Zadeh’s engrossing study uncovers, with great erudition, the genesis and many afterlives of an extraordinary book, illuminating its continued power to inspire and amaze readers in our present day.”― **Richard Ovenden, author of** Burning the Books: A History of the Deliberate Destruction of Knowledge 
“A wide-ranging and enchanting study…Zadeh has traced the history of al-Qazwini’s books in the centuries after their author’s death, their abbreviations, expansions, imitations and glorious illustrations.”― **Robert Irwin** **,** Literary Review 
“A magnificent and essential book. Zadeh deftly illuminates centuries of occult and natural history, restoring Qazwīnī's place in this vast world of thought. The result is an astonishing work of Islamic intellectual and cultural history, one that delves deeply into the intricacies and the pleasures of wonder without the prism of orientalism.”― **Rana Safvi, author of** Shahjahanabad: The Living City of Old Delhi 
“Beautifully written and deeply researched, this book explores the religious and intellectual importance of wonder in Islamic civilization through the study of a classic text. A must-read!”― **Jamal J. Elias, author of** Aisha’s Cushion: Religious Art, Perception, and Practice in Islam

"Dickie, Tenzin","Tenzin Dickie","The first English-language anthology of contemporary Tibetan fiction available in the West, Old Demons, New Deities brings together the best Tibetan writers from both Tibet and the diaspora, who write in Tibetan, English and Chinese. Modern Tibetan literature is just under forty years old: its birth dates to 1980, when the first Tibetan language journal was published in Lhasa. Since then, short stories have become one of the primary modern Tibetan art forms. Through these sometimes absurd, sometimes strange, and always moving stories, the English-reading audience gets an authentic look at the lives of ordinary, secular, modern Tibetans navigating the space between tradition and modernity, occupation and exile, the personal and the national. The setting may be the Himalayas, an Indian railway, or a New York City brothel, but the insights into an ancient culture and the lives and concerns of a modern people are real, and powerful. For this anthology, editor and translator Tenzin Dickie has collected 21 short stories by 16 of the most respected and well known Tibetan writers working today, including Pema Bhum, Pema Tseden, Tsering Dondrup, Woeser, Tsering Wangmo Dhompa, Kyabchen Dedrol, and Jamyang Norbu.

"Jain, Danesh & Cardona, George","Danesh Jain & George Cardona","The Indo-Aryan languages are spoken by at least 700 million people throughout India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands. They have a claim to great antiquity, with the earliest Vedic Sanskrit texts dating to the end of the second millennium B.C. With texts in Old Indo-Aryan, Middle Indo-Aryan and Modern Indo-Aryan, this language family supplies a historical documentation of language change over a longer period than any other subgroup of Indo-European. This volume is divided into two main sections dealing with general matters and individual languages. Each chapter on the individual language covers the phonology and grammar (morphology and syntax) of the language and its writing system, and gives the historical background and information concerning the geography of the language and the number of its speakers.

"McCutcheon, Russell T.","Russell T. McCutcheon","Widely used as a primer, a class text, or just a provocation to critical thinking, Studying Religion clearly explains the methods and theories employed in the academic study of religion by tackling the problem of how scholars define and then study religion. Written for all newcomers to the field, its brief chapters explore the three main ways in which religion is defined and, along the way, also consider a range of related topics, from the history and functions of religion to its public discourse, religion in the courts, and the classification of diverse groups into world religions. 
The works of classic and contemporary scholars—from Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud to Bruce Lincoln and Naomi Goldenberg—are analyzed and explored in readable chapters and detailed supporting materials. Studying Religion represents a shift away from the traditional descriptive and comparative approach and, instead, uses the study of religion to invite readers to consider how they divide up, name, and come to know the world around them. 
This edition also includes a new final chapter, Identification Matters, adding to the case studies included throughout this book to present a collection of contemporary instances where different approaches to defining and studying religion make it possible to study other issues of contemporary relevance, including those involving gender, race, and the rights of indigenous peoples. The new chapter makes explicit the practical topics of identity and status that have always been implicit throughout the entire book, bringing into the classroom a wide variety of timely and relevant topics that can be better understood by its approach. This book therefore remains invaluable to all students of religious studies—whether in the introductory class or as an example of an alternative way of approaching the field.

"Moore, D.","D. Moore","In Overcoming Religious Illiteracy, Harvard professor and Phillips Academy teacher Diane L. Moore argues that though the United States is one of the most religiously diverse nations in the world, the vast majority of citizens are woefully ignorant about religion itself and the basic tenets of the world's major religious traditions. The consequences of this religious illiteracy are profound and include fueling the culture wars, curtailing historical understanding and promoting religious and racial bigotry. In this volume, Moore combines theory with practice to articulate how to incorporate the study of religion into the schools in ways that will invigorate classrooms and enhance democratic discourse in the public sphere.
### Review
'Moore's new book is a vitally important contribution to the growing international literature on educating the public especially the young about religions. At a time when learning about religion is being debated in Asian, African and Middle Eastern countries and when international bodies such as UNESCO, the Council of Europe and the Office for Security and Cooperation in Europe are giving close attention to teaching and learning about religions, Moore's important book will attract much attention internationally.' - Robert Jackson, DLitt Director, Warwick Religions and Education Research Unit, Institute of Education, University of Warwick and Editor of the British Journal of Religious Education
Moore has brought insight, clarity, common sense, and long experience to one of the most important and contentious issues of our day-the question of religion in the public schools. Religious literacy goes to the heart of the purpose of education in a democracy that can no longer afford to remain uneducated about the world's religions. This book is a must-read for teachers, school administrators, parents, and every citizen concerned with the quality of American education.' - Diana L. Eck, Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies and Director of The Pluralism Project, Harvard University
'Moore's lucid, thoughtful book wrestles with a fundamental educational question-what should we teach our children? She argues persuasively the critical importance of religious literacy for survival in the 21st century and goes deeply into the contentious debates around the teaching of religion in public schools. Moore convinces that we keep the teaching of world religions out of our schools at our own peril. Read it, debate it, act on it.' Steve Seidel, Bauman and Bryant Chair in Arts and Education, Graduate School of Education, and Director of Project Zero, Harvard University
'In a world fraught with religious and cultural conflicts, Moore models how to teach about religion respectfully as part of the goal of educating for democratic citizenship. What is unique about this book is that the author explores both the philosophy as well as the pedagogical challenges of using a cultural studies approach to teach about religion. This important book will be of interest to educators and any citizen concerned about our country's religious illiteracy.' - Marya R. Levenson, Professor of the Practice in Education and the Harry S. Levitan Director of the Education Program, Brandeis University
""Overcoming Religious Illiteracy is unique. Moore not only persuades us about why we ought to teach about religion in our public schools, but she also tells us how to do it-practically, sensitively, and effectively."" - James W. Fraser, Professor, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, New York University
'Religious illiteracy in our country and in the world is rampant. Ignorance of the faith and cultural practices of others is the source of great misunderstanding and suffering. Moore's book proposes an inquiry-based approach for American public schools that opens the door to religious discussion and reflection in an atmosphere of respect and cultural awareness. This book is pioneering. It offers a strong base of theory and concrete foundations for practice to bring a new dimension to teaching about diversity.' - Renee Cherow-O'Leary, Assistant Professor of English Education, Teachers College, Columbia University
""In recent years religion has become a dominant feature of global politics and American public life. Today active participation as informed citizens in our multicultural society demands knowledge of the world's religious traditions. Moore's Overcoming Religious Illiteracy offers a template for achieving that goal. It should be required reading for all secondary school educators.' - Donald K. Swearer, Director of the Center for the Study of World Religions and Distinguished Visiting Professor of Buddhist Studies, Harvard Divinity School
'Moore convincingly argues that religion should be taught in public schools by giving both solid theoretical reasons and productive examples of how to do so practically. I am sure this fascinating study will enrich the debate not only in academic circles but in public discourse as well. This is a remarkable and innovative book that should be widely read by Americans and Europeans alike.' - Wolfram Weisse, Professor of Religious Education, University of Hamburg and Director of the Centre for World Religions in Dialogue
""In a world marked by the inability of societies to engage with religious difference, the need to combat religious and cultural illiteracy has become urgent. Diane Moore presents a strong and convincing case for the inclusion of the study of religion as a cultural phenomenon in the curricula of schools and, indeed, for a liberal arts college education. She persuasively demonstrates the destabilizing consequences of religious illiteracy for the proper functioning of democratic societies. A must read for anyone concerned with the crucial role of education in fostering healthy multiracial, multicultural and multireligious societies."" - Ali S. Asani, Professor of the Practice of Indo-Muslim Languages and Cultures, Harvard University
""Overcoming Religious Illiteracy is a must read for those concerned with the future of public education in a multi-religious society. Moore offers thoughtful suggestions for educators preparing to tackle this difficult subject.' - Adam Strom, Director of Research and Development, Facing History and Ourselves
'Teachers everywhere should welcome Overcoming Religious Illiteracy. Finally here is a text that gives instructors the perspective and tools they need to teach about religion in a way that avoids the shrill stereotypes, over simplistic assumptions, and unexamined sectarianism that too often beleaguers this topic. Moore links theory with practice, offering educators both methodologies and resources to teach responsibly and creatively about religion.' - Susan McCaslin, Instructor in Philosophy and Religious Studies and Associate Dean of Faculty, Phillips Academy
'Moore's well-written and very readable book, Overcoming Religious Illiteracy, is important for two reasons. It is a cogent guide for any district, school or teacher looking to integrate the study or discussion of religion into the curriculum and it outlines clear steps for making any class a learning-centered, inquiry based experience where students participate fully in the teaching and learning process.' - Charles Skidmore, Principal, Arlington High School
'Concerned by the detrimental consequences of religious illiteracy and the divisive nature of the culture wars, Moore appeals to teachers in particular for change. She argues that teachers should be 'treated as professionals, supported as scholars, recognized as moral agents, and given voice as public intellectuals.' An award winning educator, Moore offers teaching models for constructing learning communities to stimulate student-centered inquiry about religions while remaining respectful of religious beliefs.
How refreshing! This is a book of fundamental importance to those interested in educational reform.' Heidi Roupp, World History teacher and founding member of the World History Association
""Moore takes her readers seriously, as she does her students, and challenges us to debate the purpose of education, especially vis-à-vis democracy and the possibilities inherent in talking to each other across differences. Her contributions to this conversation are based on years of classroom teaching as well as scholarship, but she ultimately defies stale scholarly logic: she deftly bridges the chasm between theory and practice, and she dares express an optimism so profound that it is a form of resistance in itself."" -Shipley Robertson Salewski, Teacher, 8th Grade English, KIPP Summit Academy
'Moore's in-depth case studies provide teachers with what is often the missing element in substantial theoretical work-how to transfer the intellectual concepts they find compelling into the classroom. Moore does so in a way that will have impact for both teachers and students.' - Clare R. Sisisky, Director and Teacher, Center for the Humanities, Henrico County Public Schools

"Storm, Jason Ananda Josephson & Josephson, Jason Ānanda","Jason Ananda Josephson Storm & Jason Ānanda Josephson","A great many theorists have argued that the defining feature of modernity is that people no longer believe in spirits, myths, or magic. Jason Ā. Josephson-Storm argues that as broad cultural history goes, this narrative is wrong, as attempts to suppress magic have failed more often than they have succeeded. Even the human sciences have been more enchanted than is commonly supposed. But that raises the question: How did a magical, spiritualist, mesmerized Europe ever convince itself that it was disenchanted? Josephson-Storm traces the history of the myth of disenchantment in the births of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, folklore, psychoanalysis, and religious studies. Ironically, the myth of mythless modernity formed at the very time that Britain, France, and Germany were in the midst of occult and spiritualist revivals. Indeed, Josephson-Storm argues, these disciplines’ founding figures were not only aware of, but profoundly enmeshed in, the occult milieu; and it was specifically in response to this burgeoning culture of spirits and magic that they produced notions of a disenchanted world. By providing a novel history of the human sciences and their connection to esotericism, The Myth of Disenchantment dispatches with most widely held accounts of modernity and its break from the premodern past.

"Pereltsvaig, Asya & Lewis, Martin W.","Asya Pereltsvaig & Martin W. Lewis","Over the past decade, a group of prolific and innovative evolutionary biologists has sought to reinvent historical linguistics through the use of phylogenetic and phylogeographical analysis, treating cognates like genes and conceptualizing the spread of languages in terms of the diffusion of viruses. Using these techniques, researchers claim to have located the origin of the Indo-European language family in Neolithic Anatolia, challenging the near-consensus view that it emerged in the grasslands north of the Black Sea thousands of years later. But despite its widespread celebration in the global media, this new approach fails to withstand scrutiny. As languages do not evolve like biological species and do not spread like viruses, the model produces incoherent results, contradicted by the empirical record at every turn. This book asserts that the origin and spread of languages must be examined primarily through the time-tested techniques of linguistic analysis, rather than those of evolutionary biology.
### Review
""This book provides an excellent guide to what can and what can’t be done in historical linguistics and Indo-European studies, and it offers a much-needed counterblast to much recent work in the field.""   
James Clackson, University of Cambridge
### Book Description
This book challenges media-celebrated evolutionary studies linking Indo-European languages to Neolithic Anatolia, instead defending traditional practices in historical linguistics.

Dalit intellectuals theorize Indian historiography and social sciences through the lenses of humiliation and dignity, pointing to the painful history of Dalit groups (formerly called untouchables) and the contemporary perpetuation of caste inequality. As part of a challenge to high-caste Hindu intelligentsia with privileged upbringings, DALIT STUDIES includes a high proportion of Dalit scholars from non-elite social and institutional backgrounds. Contributors analyze the work of Dalit activists across colonial and postcolonial periods, countering a tradition of viewing them as passive victims and objects of reform.

"Meinhardt, Hans","Hans Meinhardt","The pigment patterns on tropical shells are of great beauty and diversity. Their mixture of regularity and irregularity is fascinating. A particular pattern seems to follow particular rules but these rules allow variations. No two shells are identical. The motionless patterns appear to be static, and, indeed, they consist of calci?ed material. However, as will be shown in this book, the underlying mechanism that generates this beauty is eminently dynamic. It has much in common with other dynamic systems that generate patterns, such as a wind-sand system that forms large dunes, or rain and erosion that form complex rami?ed river systems. On other shells the underlying mechanism has much in common with waves such as those commonly observed in the spread of an epidemic. A mollusk can only enlarge its shell at the shell margin. In most cases, only at this margin are new elements of the pigmentation pattern added. Therefore, the shell pattern preserves the record of a process that took place over time in a narrow zone at the growing edge. A certain point on the shell represents a certain moment in its history. Like a time machine one can go into the past or the future just by turning the shell back and forth. Having this complete historical record opens the possibility of decoding the generic principles behind this beauty.
### Review
Review of the 4th edition: It is a strikingly beautiful book, with more than a hundred color illustrations of patterns on mollusk shells, side by side with the computer simulations that reproduce them. This bestiary of pattern formation includes stripes (straight or produced by traveling waves), dots, drops, triangles, and meshwork combined in any imaginable way. It is truly remarkable that this diversity of patterns seems to have arisen in the absence of any selective pressure, as the animals that express them spend their lives buried in mud or sand. Thus, these patterns are in essence a manifestation of Nature at play. Meinhardt has a great knack for explaining pattern-forming mechanisms in a non-technical way. In the first few chapters of his book he introduces us to the basic elements of his model in accessible and vivid terms. He shows how local non-linear self-activation combined with a rapidly diffusible repressor (or limiting substrate) leads to the formation of dots and stripes from homogeneous initial conditions, a phenomenon first described by Turing in 1952 as diffusion-driven instability. He then goes on to explain how oscillating patterns and traveling waves can be produced by the same basic model with different decay and diffusion rates. Here, the author and the book are at their best. Johannes Jaeger in: Bioessays 32: 638–640, 2010 WILEY Periodicals, Inc., DOI 10.1002/bies.201000031 From the reviews of the third edition:
This is a serious volume on the mathematical modeling of sea shell patterns. … This volume takes a rigorous approach, progressing systematically … . It would make a great text for either a course at the upper undergraduate or graduate level in mathematics or biology designed around it. It would also be a good supplemental text for a course in dynamical systems, differential equations … . It has left me with a new appreciation, wonder and curiosity about the myriad patterns on shells … ."" (Amy Shell-Gellasch,MAA online, January, 2005)
### From the Back Cover
The patterns on the shells of tropical sea snails are not only compellingly beautiful but also tell a tale of biological development. The decorative patterns are records of their own genesis, which follows laws like those of dune formation or the spread of a flu epidemic. Hans Meinhardt has analyzed the dynamical processes that form these patterns and retraced them faithfully in computer simulations. His book is exciting not only for the astonishing scientific knowledge it reveals but also for its fascinating pictures.

Conspicuous geometric features such as the bilateral sym and beauty metry of leaves, the rotational symmetry of flowers, and the helical arrangements of scales in pine cones have been studied most exten sively. This focus is reflected in a quotation from Weyl [159, page 3], ""Beauty is bound up with symmetry. "" This book explores two other factors that organize plant structures and therefore contribute to their beauty. The first is the elegance and relative simplicity of developmental algorithms, that is, the rules which describe plant development in time. The second is self-similarity, char acterized by Mandelbrot [95, page 34] as follows: When each piece of a shape is geometrically similar to the whole, both the shape and the cascade that generate it are called self-similar. This corresponds with the biological phenomenon described by Herman, Lindenmayer and Rozenberg [61]: In many growth processes of living organisms, especially of plants, regularly repeated appearances of certain multicel lular structures are readily noticeable. . . . In the case of a compound leaf, for instance, some of the lobes (or leaflets), which are parts of a leaf at an advanced stage, have the same shape as the whole leaf has at an earlier stage. Thus, self-similarity in plants is a result of developmental processes. Growth and By emphasizing the relationship between growth and form, this book form follows a long tradition in biology.

"Flake, Gary William","Gary William Flake","Gary William Flake develops in depth the simple idea that recurrent rules can produce rich and complicated behaviors. 
In this book Gary William Flake develops in depth the simple idea that recurrent rules can produce rich and complicated behaviors. Distinguishing ""agents"" (e.g., molecules, cells, animals, and species) from their interactions (e.g., chemical reactions, immune system responses, sexual reproduction, and evolution), Flake argues that it is the computational properties of interactions that account for much of what we think of as ""beautiful"" and ""interesting. 
"" From this basic thesis, Flake explores what he considers to be today's four most interesting computational topics: fractals, chaos, complex systems, and adaptation. 
Each of the book's parts can be read independently, enabling even the casual reader to understand and work with the basic equations and programs. Yet the parts are bound together by the theme of the computer as a laboratory and a metaphor for understanding the universe. The inspired reader will experiment further with the ideas presented to create fractal landscapes, chaotic systems, artificial life forms, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks.

"Arendt, Hannah","Hannah Arendt","In the first volume of her landmark philosophical work, The Origins of Totalitarianism, the political theorist traces the rise of antisemitism in Europe. Since it was first published in 1951, The Origins of Totalitarianism has been recognized as the definitive philosophical account of the totalitarian mindset. A probing analysis of Nazism, Stalinism, and the “banality of evil”, it remains one of the most referenced works in studies and discussions of totalitarian movements around the world. 
In this first volume, Antisemitism, Dr. Hannah Arendt traces the rise of antisemitism to Central and Western European Jewish history during the 19th century. With the appearance of the first political activity by antisemitic parties in the 1870s and 1880s, Arendt states, the machinery that led to the horrors of the Holocaust was set in motion. The Dreyfus Affair, in Arendt’s view, was “a kind of dress rehearsal”—the first modern use of antisemitism as an instrument of public policy and of hysteria as a political weapon.

"Burnell, Arthur Coke","Arthur Coke Burnell","This book was originally published prior to 1923, and represents a reproduction of an important historical work, maintaining the same format as the original work. While some publishers have opted to apply OCR (optical character recognition) technology to the process, we believe this leads to sub-optimal results (frequent typographical errors, strange characters and confusing formatting) and does not adequately preserve the historical character of the original artifact. We believe this work is culturally important in its original archival form. While we strive to adequately clean and digitally enhance the original work, there are occasionally instances where imperfections such as blurred or missing pages, poor pictures or errant marks may have been introduced due to either the quality of the original work or the scanning process itself. Despite these occasional imperfections, we have brought it back into print as part of our ongoing global book preservation commitment, providing customers with access to the best possible historical reprints. We appreciate your understanding of these occasional imperfections, and sincerely hope you enjoy seeing the book in a format as close as possible to that intended by the original publisher.

"Krishnamurti, Bhadriraju","Bhadriraju Krishnamurti","The Dravidian languages are spoken by nearly 200 million people in South Asia and in diaspora communities around the world. They include Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu, as well as over 20 non-literary languages. Bhadriraju Krishnamurti, one of the most eminent Dravidianists of our time, provides a linguistic overview of the Dravidian language family. He describes its history and writing system, discusses its structure and typology, and considers its lexicon. Distant and more recent contacts between Dravidian and other language groups are also covered.
### Review

""This volume deserves to be on the bookshelf of every Dravidianist, and will serve as a distinguished source book for material on historical and comparative Dravidian linguistics for some time to come"" - Sanford B. Steever, new Canaan, CT
